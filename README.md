A system for viewing and making reservations at different campsites in national parks according to available dates. Park and site information and reservations are stored in a database. 

This is a C# .NET console application that can be run from MS Visual Studio. Database queries are prepared for SQL Server. First, create a database titled "Campgrounds", then run "db/schema.sql" and "db/data.sql".

# campground-reservations
Tech Elevator pair project, week 6

This project was created to simulate a campsite reservation system for different parks, with the following requirements:

1. As a user of the system, I need the ability to view a list of the available parks in the system, sorted alphabetically by name.  
a. A park includes an id, name, location, established date, area, annual visitor count, and description. 
 
2. As a user of the system, I need the ability to select a park that my customer is visiting and see a list of all campgrounds for that available park.  
a. A campground includes an id, name, open month, closing month, and a daily fee. 
 
3. As a user of the system, I need the ability to select a campground and search for date availability so that I can make a reservation. 
a. A reservation search only requires the desired campground, a start date, and an end date. 
b. A campsite is unavailable if any part of their preferred date range overlaps with an existing reservation. 
c. If no campsites are available, indicate to the user that there are no available sites and ask them if they would like to enter in an alternate date range. 
d. The available campsites should be displayed along with the cost for the total stay. 
e. BONUS:
​ If a date range is entered that occurs during the park off-season, then the user should not see any campsites available for reservation. 
 
4. As a user of the system, once I find a campsite that is open during the time window I am looking for, I need the ability to book a reservation at a selected campsite. 
a. A reservation requires a name to reserve under, a start date, and an end date. 
b. A confirmation id is presented to the user once the reservation has been submitted. 
a. Up to 5 campsites for each campground (if applicable) should be displayed if they have availability along with the cost of the total stay. 
b. The same rules apply as the campground search. 
 
6. BONUS: As a user of the system, I would like the ability to see a list of all upcoming reservations within the next 30 days for a selected national park.
